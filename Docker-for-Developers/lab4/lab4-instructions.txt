Lab 4
Make sure to stop tomcat container from prior labs.

1) create a swarm on your laptop.  Validate the swarm is up and running (docker node ls)

2) Create a Docker stack file that will use the image from lab2

You will need to expose both ports 8080 and 8443. 

3) Once you have the docker stack file deploy the stack as tomcatlab2


4) To validate that tomcat is up and running correctly (use a browser or curl cmd)
When using ssl you will have to add an exception for the URL. 
You can use the two urls (listed below) to validate that tomcat is up and running. 
You should see the tomcat landing page. 
If you use curl you will see the raw result.  For curl, use the -k option.

http://localhost:8080
https://localhost:8443

5) Also show the stack and services that are running.
